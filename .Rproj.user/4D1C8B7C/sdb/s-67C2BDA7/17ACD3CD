It is sourced\n#       by the MOS ui.R file when the application is initialized.\n#\n#       Non-functional example code has been provided in each configuration\n#       section. A working example project with code can be observed here:\n#       https://github.com/bwaismeyer/MOS_demo\n#\n#       You can see the example project in action here:\n#       http://ec2-52-26-165-185.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3939/MOS_demo/\n#\n# SCRIPT OUTLINE:\n# - Name the Application Instance\n#   - This is the title that will be displayed in the instance navigation and\n#     should be a very concise description.\n#\n# - Import and Name the Data Object as Needed\n#   - The multinomial logit model needs to be fit to a dataset. This dataset\n#     needs to be be an R data frame named \"base_data\" (no quotes).\n#   - This section is where the data frame is created (however that needs to \n#     be done) and assigned to \"base_data\".\n#\n# - Specify the Multinomial Logit Formula\n#   - The multinomial logit formula needs to be provided explicitly and it\n#     needs to appropriately reference the \"base_data\" data frame. The formula\n#     needs to be assigned to \"base_formula\".\n#\n# - Variable Configuration\n#   - We need to specify which variables will the user will be able to interact\n#     with (via slider or facet). Key information must be provided for each\n#     of these variables. See the section for details.\n#\n# - Custom Visualization Colors (Optional)\n#   - Assign the custom colors (the same number as there are outcomes) to\n#     the character string \"custom_outcome_colors\".\n#   - If you don't want to use custom colors, set \"custom_outcome_colors\" to \n#     NULL.\n#\n# - Custom bootstrap.css (Optional)\n#   - The bootstrap.css file should be placed in a subdirectory of the\n#     application titled \"www\".\n#   - Assign the name of the bootstrap.css file to the character string \n#     \"custom_css\" (just the name, Shiny will know to look in \"www\").\n#   - If you don't want to use a custom bootstrap.css, set \"custom_css\" to NULL.\n#   - If you want to load multiple CSS files, you will need to update the \n#     appropriate section of ui.R directly.\n#\n# - Custom Footer Text (Optional)\n#   - Provide a character string that will be HTML formatted. Some default\n#     CSS styling is provided by you may want to define a \"footer\" class\n#     and specify your own formatting.\n#   - Set footer_text to NULL or an empty string if you do not want a custom\n#     footer.\n#\n# - Ribbon Plot Addendum (Optional)\n#   - If you want to provide any additional text (e.g., caveats, general\n#     context) beneath the ribbon plot text body, you can assign an HTML-\n#     formatted string to \"ribbon_plot_addendum\".\n#   - Set this variable to NULL if you don't want to add anything.\n#\n# - Dot Cloud Plot Addendum (Optional)\n#   - Same but for the dot cloud plot (dot_cloud_addendum).\n#   - Set this variable to NULL if you don't want to add anything.\n#\n# - About Section\n#   - Place to specify more general information about the application instance -\n#     especially useful to avoid cluttering the Explore/Single Case pages with\n#     excess text.\n#   - The entire page will be nicely centered (8 wide with a buffer of 2 on\n#     both sides). You simply need to provide a plain text title and HTML\n#     formatted body.\n\n###############################################################################\n## Name the Application Instance\n\nMOS_instance_name <- \"The Case Outcome Simulator\"\n\n###############################################################################\n## Import and Name the Data Object as Needed\n\n# source the base data and base model\nload(\"cos_data_6-25-15.RData\")\n\n# explicitly choose the data object we will be working with\n# NOTE: incomplete cases will be dropped to avoid modeling/plotting issues\nbase_data <- data[which(complete.cases(data)), ]\n\n# ensure the levels in the outcome variable are in RAGE order\nbase_data$outcome <- factor(base_data$outcome, c(\"Reunification\", \n                                                 \"Adoption\",\n                                                 \"Guardianship\", \n                                                 \"Emancipation\"))\n\n# clean out the funny 27 year old case...\nbase_data <- base_data[base_data$log_age_eps_begin < 3, ]\n\n###############################################################################\n## Specify the Multinomial Logit Formula\n\n# Note that the formula needs to correctly reference the base_data object\n# column names.\nbase_formula <-\n    # outcome column\n    outcome ~ \n    # additive terms\n    mist_scores + wrkg_scores + log_age_eps_begin + log_par_age + \n    rel_plc + employ + housing_hs_cnt + hhnum_c + sm_coll + married\n    # interaction terms\n\n###############################################################################\n## Variable Configuration\n\n# The following features must be specified for every model variable that you\n# want the user to be able to see and interact with.\n\n# variable_configuration <- list(\n#     RAW_NAME = list(\n#         pretty_name         = UI_friendly name (REQUIRED),\n#         definition          = a concise explanation of how the user should\n#                               understand the variable (OPTIONAL),\n#         ribbon_plot_summary = a concise summary of the trends observed in the\n#                               ribbon plot when this variable is seleted as\n#                               the x-axis (OPTIONAL, only useful for slider\n#                               variables),\n#         custom_x_breaks     = NULL or a numeric vector explicitly specifying\n#                               the breaks to be used in the ribbon plot\n#                               for this variable,\n#         custom_x_labels     = NULL or a character vector with as many items\n#                               as there are ribbon plot x-axis ticks;
